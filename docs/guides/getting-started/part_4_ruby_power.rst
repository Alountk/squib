The Squib Way pt 4: Ruby Power!
===============================

.. warning::

  To be written.


This part is about cataloging some powerful things you can do if you're willing to write some Ruby.

* Modifying XML at runtime (e.g. convert to black-and-white from color)
* Using Travis to build and then post to something like Dropbox
* Scaling the size of text based on its contents
* Advanced Array techniques: inject, transpose, map, join (use the pre-req example)
* Building newlines yourself (i.e. with your own placeholder like "%n" in Your Last Heist)
* Summarization card backs for Your Last Heist as an example
* "Lacks" string for Your Last Heist
* Rules doc written in Markdown
