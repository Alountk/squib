Get Help
--------

Squib is powerful and customizablem, which means it can get complicated pretty quickly. Don't settle for being stuck.

Here's an ordered list of how to find help:

1. Go through this documentation
2. Go through `the wiki <https://github.com/andymeneely/squib/wiki`_
3. Go through `the samples https://github.com/andymeneely/squib/tree/master/samples>`_
4. Google it - people have asked lots of questions about Squib already in many forums.
5. Ask on Stackoverflow `using the tags "ruby" and "squib" <http://stackoverflow.com/questions/ask?tags=ruby squib>`_. You will get answers quickly from Ruby programmers it's and a great way for us to archive questions for future Squibbers.
6. Our `thread on BoardGameGeek <http://boardgamegeek.com/thread/1293453>`_ is quite active and informal (if a bit unstructured).

If you email me directly I'll probably ask you to post your question publicly so we can document answers for future Googling Squibbers.

Please use GitHub issues for bugs and feature requests.

Help by Troubleshooting
-----------------------

One of the best ways you can help the Squib community is to be active on the above forums. Help people out. Answer questions. Share your code. Most of those forums have a "subscribe" feature.

You can also watch the project on GitHub, which means you get notified when new bugs and features are entered.

Help by Fixing Bugs
-------------------

A great way to make yourself known in the community is to go over `our backlog <https://github.com/andymeneely/squib/issues>`_ and work on fixing bugs. Even suggestions on troubleshooting what's going on (e.g. trying it out on different OS versions) can be a big help.
