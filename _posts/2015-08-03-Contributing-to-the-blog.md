We want contributions!! Here's how you can help.

1. Fork the git repository ( https://github.com/[my-github-username]/squib/fork )
2. Switch to the `gh-pages` branch
3. Write your new post, building locally with Jekyll along the way
4. Create your feature branch (git checkout -b my-new-feature)
5. Commit your changes (git commit -am 'Add some post')
6. Push to the branch (git push origin my-new-feature)
7. Create a new Pull Request

We'll review your entry and get it ready for posting.
